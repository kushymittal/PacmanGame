# Maze Solver

This program reads in and parses a maze file
and finds a solution to the maze using various
algorithms subject to certain constraints.

# Implementation Details

The mazes contain constraints such as walls,
obstacles, energy boosts and monsters. These
constraints can easily be triggered on/off 
from the code.

The algorithms used to find solutions include
informed as well as uninformed searches. The
uninformed searches use recursive depth first
search and breadth first search. The informed
search uses algorithms such as greedy best first
search as well as A-star. (Artificial Intelligence)

# Motivation

This project is meant for me dabble in artificial
intelligence.
